# 🛠 How the Application Works

## Step 1 — Start Coaching

When the user opens the application, they see a field at the top:

> "Describe your startup to begin coaching."

The founder enters a short startup description and clicks:

🚀 **Start Coaching**

This sends the message to the backend, where CrewAI starts the coaching workflow.

---

## Step 2 — Real-Time Pitch Coach Chat

After starting:

- The AI Pitch Coach begins an interactive structured chat  
- The founder replies step by step  
- The coach provides warm, supportive, actionable feedback  

---

## Step 3 — Voice Recording + Transcription

At the bottom of the page, the founder has a modern chat composer.

They can:

🎙️ Click the microphone button  
Speak naturally (messy and unstructured is okay)

The system will:

- Record audio  
- Send it to the backend  
- Return the transcription inside the textarea automatically  

---

## Step 4 — Refine text Button (Professional Rewrite)

Transcribed text may be:

- unclear  
- repetitive  
- too long  
- unstructured  
- full of filler words  

The founder can click:

🗯 **Refine**

The CrewAI improvement agent rewrites the message into a clear, professional investor-ready pitch while keeping the exact meaning.

Example:

Raw transcription:

> "So yeah we build like AI platform for warehouses and safety stuff..."

Refined output:

> "We are building an AI-powered safety monitoring platform for warehouses to detect risks early and reduce workplace accidents."

## Step 5 — Sending the Message

Once ready, the founder clicks:

➤ **Send**

After sending:
 
- The AI coach responds in real time
